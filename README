### Class::ArrayObjects - enum facilities for array based objects


This module makes it easy to build classes using array based objects.
It's main goal is to allow one to create less memory hungry programs,
notably in memory-sensitive contexts such as mod_perl.

It is fully documented so you may wish to read the doc for further
details.

It can be installed in the usual ways:

 - from within the cpan shell (perl -MCPAN -e shell):

   install Class::ArrayObjects

 - after having downloaded it from CPAN, and extracted from its
 archive:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Note to Win32 users: there is currently no PPM for this package as it
isn't necessary. Simply use one of the above methods, replacing make
with nmake or whatever other make facility you have available (a fair
number are available online for free).

This module is licensed under the same terms as Perl itself.
